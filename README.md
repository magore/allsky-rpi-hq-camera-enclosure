## AllSky enclosure for Raspberry Pi and HQ Camera 
* Includes CAD models in Fusion 360<br>

* Supports Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 Models<br>

* Supports optional Ethernet with POE hats<br>

* Includes BME280 Weather Sensor with Temperature, Humidity and Air Pressure<br>
  + I hacked in the display of Weather sensor information. I just need to convert the code to the new module format and will share that once done.
