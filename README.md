## Backround of this project
  * I started the ALLSKY Camera Enclosure project back in 2020 and have been using versions of it for the past several years
  * I created CAD models using Fusion 360 
  * I am now at the point where I feel comfortable with the design so I am completing documention presently

## Software requirement
https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky - this runs on the Raspberry PI<br>

## Hardware requirements
* Not all hardware listed is used - it depends on the Raspberry Pi version 4 or 5 and POE Hat used
* I used kits of stainless steel screws, brass hex spacers and JST connectors so specific part numbers for those items are not included. You can find them on Amazon
